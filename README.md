## SPICED Academy /// Week 06 /// Docker<br><br>
Within the sixth week of SPICED Academy, I extractecd, transformed and loaded data from twitter and stored various applications in different Docker container. 

In concret, the goals was to extract information from twitter, store the data in MongoDB, transform it and store the transfomred data in a PostgreSQL database. There are four different Docker containers, one each for MongoDB, PostgreSQL, tweet_collector and ETL. Just for fun; tweets on Mariah Carey and Wham were collected.
